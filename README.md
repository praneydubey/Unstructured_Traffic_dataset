# Unstructured_Traffic_dataset
dataset for unstructured traffic
Robustness of autonomous driving of vehicles is critical for the safe deployment of the system. Robustness of the systems also depends on environment for which it is being evaluated. In this work we have focused on unstructured driving environment where, other than weather and road conditions, traffic conditions are also difficult to be identified and analyzed to make right driving decision. We have created dataset where traffic is highly congested, with uneven roads, vague or absence of division of road as well as dividers, less predictable behavior of pedestrian and other bike and vehicles. The dataset comprises of more than 100,000 images under variety of conditions. Each images are segmented using Segment-Anything Model. Each images, contains on an average more than 50 segments, whose annotations (>50 class of labels) were created using LLMs and reverified by human annotator for quality assessment. We have also created inertial sensor data along with vehicle speed to safe limits for acceleration, break and speed maintenance for each scenario.
